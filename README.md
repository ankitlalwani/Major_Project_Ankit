# Hospital Readmission Prevalence: An analytics approach to reduce hospital readmissions

Hospital readmission is the most vital contributor towards total medical care expenditure and is an emerging indicator towards quality of care. Research shows that approximately 15%- 20% of the people discharged from the hospital are readmitted within 30 days from the date of discharge. Some of those readmissions are voluntarily, however some are just preventable. The hospital admission process is exhaustive; hence readmitting is equally tough for both the patient and the hospital. Reducing the hospital readmissions is a win for both patient and the hospital. Diabetes, like any other chronic disease is associated with increased risk of hospital readmissions. Risk factor includes previous hospitalizations, age, gender, previous diagnoses and other socio-economic barriers. As a part of this project, an analytical approach is taken to understand the crucial factors involved for readmission of diabetic patients. Various data pre-processing and classification algorithms have been applied to understand the measures which can be taken to reduce hospital readmission.  

As a part of this project, various classification models were tried, and results were compared. The effort was to find the most accurate model based on the evaluation parameters such as precision, recall, sensitivity and F1 measure. Also, to find any similarities between the patterns extracted from each model. The following algorithms have been used:
1.	Decision Tree
2.	Random Forest
3.	Neural Network
4.	KNN
